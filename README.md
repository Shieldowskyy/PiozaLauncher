**Pioza Launcher** is an open-source launcher project created entirely in Unreal Engine 5 using blueprints. This makes it highly customizable for beginner programmers and indie game developers who want an easy and reliable way to distribute their games to players. It comes with several features, such as:

- Downloading, installing, and updating games  
- Moving files to other drives/folders  
- Displaying game descriptions, minimum requirements, screenshots, and videos  
- Playing sound effects when clicking on a game  
- Easily changing [repositories](https://github.com/Shieldowskyy/PiozaGameLauncher/wiki/PiozaRepo-(and-manifest)) via the console  
- Extending functionality with custom console libraries and more
- Creating backups of downloaded games  
- Making shortcut in start menu and on desktop
- Playtime tracking
- Linux system support
- [Offline Mode](https://github.com/Shieldowskyy/PiozaLauncher/wiki/Offline-Mode)
- Easy localization of game metadata  

### Planned Features:

- Verifying game files using checksums  
- Adding notes in the launcher menu for specific games  
- Support for changelogs based on HTML files
- Actions queue
# Download

You can find the installer and zipped build in the [Releases](https://github.com/Shieldowskyy/PiozaGameLauncher/releases) tab.  
**Note:** The zipped build is **not portable** — it will save its configuration in the `LocalAppData` directory.

- **Windows:** Available both as an installer (`.exe`) and a zipped build. Winget install script is also available below.
- **Linux:** Available as .rpm and AppImage. Install script is also available below.


## Windows
### Support

Windows version supports all features and **does not require proton and dependencies** (which are shipped with release)

### 🖥️ Installation


#### Winget

````

To uninstall it later, run:

```bash
curl -sSL dsh.yt/pioza.sh -o /tmp/pioza.sh
bash /tmp/pioza.sh --uninstall
```

### Dependencies

The Linux version of Pioza Launcher requires a few system dependencies:

- `vulkan` - required to run launcher gui
- `zenity` – used for file picker dialogs  
- `libnotify` - used for sending system notifications
- `python3` - used for running umu-launcher script
- `tar` - used for unpacking game backup archives

Install these using your distribution’s package manager.

# Opening the Project in Unreal Engine

Pioza Launcher is built with Unreal Engine. I found it easier to prototype some features using Unreal Blueprints, but I plan to rewrite parts of it in C++ in the future.

## Engine

To run this project, you must install Unreal Engine 5.5 on your machine. You might also need Visual Studio with the Unreal Engine components installed to compile all plugins and C++ code.

## Plugins

All required plugins are now included in the repository!

### Optional

> [!NOTE]  
> Although you might be able to run the project without these plugins, I recommend installing them to ensure the project starts without any issues.

Sentry is optional but recommended, and therefore included with the project:
