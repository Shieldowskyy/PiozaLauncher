**Pioza Launcher** is an open-source launcher project created entirely in Unreal Engine 5 using blueprints. This makes it highly customizable for beginner programmers and indie game developers who want an easy and reliable way to distribute their games to players. It comes with several features, such as:

- Downloading, installing, and updating games  
- Moving files to other drives/folders  
- Displaying game descriptions, minimum requirements, screenshots, and videos  
- Playing sound effects when clicking on a game  
- Easily changing [repositories](https://github.com/Shieldowskyy/PiozaGameLauncher/wiki/PiozaRepo-(and-manifest)) via the console  
- Extending functionality with custom console libraries and more
- Creating backups of downloaded games  
- Making shortcut in start menu and on desktop
- Playtime tracking
- Linux system support
- [Offline Mode](https://github.com/Shieldowskyy/PiozaLauncher/wiki/Offline-Mode)

### Planned Features:
- Easy localization of game metadata  
- Merging [repositories ](https://github.com/Shieldowskyy/PiozaGameLauncher/wiki/PiozaRepo-(and-manifest)) 
- Verifying game files using checksums  
- Adding notes in the launcher menu for specific games  
- Support for changelogs based on HTML files
- Actions queue
# Download
In [Releases](https://github.com/Shieldowskyy/PiozaGameLauncher/releases) tab you will find installer and zipped build that you can install where you want.\
NOTE: Zipped build is not portable and will save config in localappdata directory.

Launcher works well under proton: **PixelRunner** and **FlipFlop** tested on Fedora 40 via Bottles and also Lutris!

# Opening project in Unreal Engine
Pioza Launcher is built on Unreal Engine. It was easier for me to write something in Unreal Blueprints for simpler prototyping, but i have plans to rewrite some elements in C++ in future.
## Engine
To run this project, you have to install Unreal Engine 5.5 on your machine! Also you might need Visual Studio with configured Unreal Engine components to compile all plugins and C++ code!
## Plugins
To open project you need to install these plugins:\
[EasyFileDialog](https://github.com/unrealsumon/EasyFileDialog) from Github or Marketplace\
and\
[File Helper Blueprint Library](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/file-helper-bp-library) from Marketplace
### Optional
> [!NOTE]
> While you might already be able to run the project without these plugin, I recommend installing it so that project can start without any problems.

You can also install Sentry Unreal plugin to report all crashes to me. It will be helpful for investigating further problems!\
